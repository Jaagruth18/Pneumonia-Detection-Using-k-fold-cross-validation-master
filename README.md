# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-k-fold-cross-validation-master
Developed a machine learning model to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using k-fold cross-validation to improve reliability and reduce overfitting. Implemented image preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training workflows, achieving consistent validation accuracy across folds.
